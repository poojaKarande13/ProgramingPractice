# Find a triplet a, b, c such that a2 = b2 + c2.
# Variations of this problem like find a triplet with sum equal to 0.
# Find a pair with given sum. All such questions are efficiently solved using hashing. â€“ Practice here

# solution
# 1. sort the arr in asc order
# 2. consider a = last element in the arr
# 3. find b and c whose sum is equal to a from the remaining item in the array
# 4. repeat the same step for all elements
# 5. return if b and c found

# complexity O(n2)
